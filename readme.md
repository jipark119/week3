# Process & Documentation
1. Sketch and Design

NYC restaurant week is one of my favorite New York events. As a big foodie, I love that I get to try awesome menus with fixed price and its a nice excuse to get all my busy friends together for a great dinner night! 
This website is inspired by strict grid system of Swiss poster design.

2. Development

This website is simple one page website and is responsive to mobile screen size. 
To fullfill 5 interactive javascript elements, I integrated five events:

* onload: Background and button color changes evertime user loads. Also, food emoji stickers are randomly positioned on load. 
* onkeypress: Although I love my emoji sticker vomit, I wanted the users to read and get their information clearly. For that function, I used spacebar key to remove stickers when pressed. 
* click: Since this is a long one page website, I thought that it was important to have some kind of navigation system for users. When user clicks top header menu, it moves to according section. 
* scroll: I've seen this affect on other websites and really wanted to try it on mine. It animates scroll percentage as user scrolls.
* mouseover: When user mouse-over About section, image background pops up.

## Challenges & Struggles
It took me awhile to figure out flex css. I think I still need time to get comfortable with it and try different box grid scenarios.
